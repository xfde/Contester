# Contester
Contester is Android application written in Java by two high school students that acts as an aggregator for contests, olympiads and other extracurricular activities.

  Behind the app is a real-time cloud database powered by Google Firebase that can send push notifications to users' phones whenever a new contest is added to it or an existing one is updated. Users can create periodical reminders for themselves for upcoming competitions which are also displayed in an easy-to-read way in the built-in calendar. 
  The main target audience for this app is high school students from Romania that are interested in participating in extracurricular activities. Currently, a similar solution does not exist and there is a real need for this app, according to feedback from several students that claim they keep missing activities for various reasons that they would have been interested in.
  The mobile app is also accompanied by a sister-website, created in React using Material-UI and hosted on Heroku, in which organizers can submit requests via forms for their competitions to be added to the database. At the moment, all requests are automatically approved, but, in the future, they will be subject to a vetting process.

The react.js is also available on github : https://github.com/xfde/contester_reactjs
